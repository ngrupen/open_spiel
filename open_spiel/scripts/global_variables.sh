# This file contains the global variables that control conditional dependencies.
# It is being used to know whether we should:
# (a) download a dependency (done in install.sh)
# (b) build it and link against it during the `cmake` build process
#
# Note that we do not change the value of the constants if they are already
# defined by an enclosing scope (useful for command line overrides).

# We add a single flag, to enable/disable all conditional dependencies, in
# particular to be able to use that in the Travis CI test.

# Each optional dependency has their own flag, that defaults to the global
# "$DEFAULT_OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCY" if undefined. To enable an optional dependency,
# we recomment defining the associated environment variable in your bashrc or
# your virtualenv bashrc, e.g. export BUILD_WITH_HANABI="ON"

# From PyTorch documentation:
#
# > If you would prefer to write Python, and can afford to write Python, we
# > recommend using the Python interface to PyTorch. However, if you would
# > prefer to write C++, or need to write C++ (because of multithreading,
# > latency or deployment requirements), the C++ frontend to PyTorch provides
# > an API that is approximately as convenient, flexible, friendly and intuitive
# > as its Python counterpart.
#
# You can find an example usage in open_spiel/libtorch/torch_integration_test.cc
