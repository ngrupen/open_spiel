# The single source of truth for the OpenSpiel pip dependencies.
#
# Note that we purposely exclude python packages used by some of the python
# algorithms or tools, as we want to keep only the dependencies absolutely
# necessary to use the python API. However, when testing using continuous
# integration like GitHub Actions, we install several more to ensure the
# proper tests are included. See open_spiel/scripts/python_extra_deps.sh
# for extra packages and their versions.
